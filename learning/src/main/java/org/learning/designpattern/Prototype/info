Prototype pattern refers to creating duplicate object while keeping performance in mind. 
This type of design pattern comes under creational pattern as this pattern provides one of the best ways to create an object.

This pattern involves implementing a prototype interface which tells to create a clone of the current object.
This pattern is used when creation of object directly is costly.

For example, an object is to be created after a costly database operation. We can cache the object, returns its clone on next 
request and update the database as and when needed thus reducing database calls.
 
 Todayâ€™s programming is all about costs. Saving is a big issue when it comes to using computer resources, so programmers are 
 doing their best to find ways of improving the performance When we talk about object creation we can find a better way to have
  new objects: cloning. To this idea one particular design pattern is related: rather than creation it uses cloning. If the cost 
  of creating a new object is large and creation is resource intensive, we clone the object.
